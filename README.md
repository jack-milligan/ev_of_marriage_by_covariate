# Expected Value of Marriage Analysis

A comprehensive data science project analyzing divorce risk and economic outcomes of marriage using IPUMS American Community Survey (ACS) data.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds predictive models to estimate:
- **Divorce risk** based on individual characteristics (age, sex, education, income, marriage cohort)
- **Economic outcomes** of marriage vs. staying single
- **Expected value (EV)** of marriage decisions by demographic group

### Key Questions
- What factors predict divorce risk?
- How does marriage affect income trajectories?
- For which demographic groups is marriage economically beneficial?

## 📊 Data

- **Source**: IPUMS American Community Survey (ACS)
- **Sample Size**: ~15 million observations
- **Time Period**: Multiple years (cohort analysis)
- **Key Variables**: Age, sex, education, income, marital status, marriage year

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ev_or_marriage_by_covariate

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from ev_of_marriage_by_covariate import load_ipums_ev_data
from risk_model import build_logit_dataset, fit_divorce_logit
from payoff_model import compute_ev_of_marriage, predict_divorce_prob

# Load data
df = load_ipums_ev_data()

# Train divorce risk model
X, y = build_logit_dataset(df, age_min=25, age_max=45)
result = fit_divorce_logit(X, y)
print(f"ROC AUC: {result['roc_auc']:.3f}")

# Calculate EV of marriage for a profile
profile = {
    "age": 32,
    "sex": "Male",
    "educ_label": "4 yrs college",
    "incwage": 80000,
    "yrmarr": 2020
}
p_divorce = predict_divorce_prob(profile, result["model"], result["scaler"], 
                                  result["num_cols"], result["feature_names"])
ev = compute_ev_of_marriage(profile, p_divorce, married_uplift=0.12, 
                            divorced_penalty=-0.08)
print(f"Expected value difference: ${ev['delta_EV_marry_minus_single']:,.0f}")
```

### Run Analysis

```bash
# Generate all visualizations
python analysis_relationships.py

# Train models and generate diagnostics
python risk_model.py

# Run EV calculations
python payoff_model.py

# Run comprehensive validation
python validation.py
```

## 📈 Key Results

### Model Performance
- **ROC AUC**: 0.687 (acceptable discrimination)
- **Brier Score**: 0.093 (good calibration)
- **Cross-validation stability**: σ = 0.001 (very stable)

### Key Findings
1. **Divorce Risk Factors**:
   - Higher education → Lower divorce risk
   - Women have slightly higher divorce rates
   - More recent marriage cohorts have higher divorce rates
   - Age at marriage matters (older = lower risk)

2. **Economic Effects**:
   - Married individuals earn ~25-37% more than never-married
   - Divorced individuals earn ~11-24% less than married
   - Income benefits of marriage are substantial

3. **Expected Value Analysis**:
   - **Marriage has positive EV for all tested demographics**
   - Break-even divorce probability: ~57% (well above observed rates)
   - Highest risk groups still show positive EV due to income benefits
   - College-educated individuals have highest EV (low risk + high income)

4. **Demographic Patterns**:
   - College-educated: 3-6% divorce risk, highest EV
   - High school only: 6-12% divorce risk, moderate EV
   - Education is strongest predictor of both divorce risk and EV

## 🔍 Validation

The project includes comprehensive validation:
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold stratified CV
- **Bootstrap validation**: Confidence intervals
- **External validation**: Comparison to known statistics
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Robustness to hyperparameters
- **Prediction reliability**: Edge case testing

Run validation:
```bash
python validation.py
```



## 📊 Visualizations

The project generates multiple diagnostic visualizations:
- ROC curves
- Calibration plots
- Feature importance
- Confusion matrices
- Precision-recall curves
- Divorce rate by demographics
- Age at marriage distributions

All saved to `visuals/` directory.

## 🧪 Model Details

### Divorce Risk Model
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression (L2 regularized)
- **Features**: Age, sex, log(income), marriage year, education (one-hot)
- **Evaluation**: ROC AUC, Brier score, calibration

### Survival Analysis
- **Model**: Cox Proportional Hazards
- **Outcome**: Time to divorce
- **Covariates**: Same as logistic model

### Economic Model
- **Method**: Regression-based income effects (controls for confounders)
- **Outcome**: Log income
- **Comparison**: Married vs. never-married, divorced vs. married

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

1. **Causal Inference**: Income effects may reflect selection bias
2. **Temporal Effects**: Cross-sectional data limits temporal analysis
3. **Missing Data**: ~40% missing marriage year (expected for never-married)
4. **Model Scope**: Focuses on economic outcomes, not other marriage benefits
5. **Generalizability**: Results specific to US population and time period
